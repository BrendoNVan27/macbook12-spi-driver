Very simple, work in progress input driver for the SPI keyboard / trackpad found on 12" MacBooks, as well a simple touchbar driver for 2016 MacBook Pro's.

Using it:
---------
To get this driver to work on a 2016 12" MacBook, you'll need to boot the kernel with `intremap=nosid`. Also, you'll need to modify your DSDT as described by Leif Liddy at https://bugzilla.kernel.org/attachment.cgi?id=206671. (but don't worry about applying patches. Also see https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/DSDT for a quicker way to load custom DSDTs without recompiling)

This should result in the intel-lpss driver attaching itself to the SPI controller, and exposing the `APP000D` device.

The 2015 MacBook seems much more complicated, as the DMA controller isn't built in to the SPI controller. Unfortunately, I don't have a 2015 model to test.

What works:
-----------
* Basic Typing
* FN keys
* Driver unloading (no more hanging)
* Basic touchpad functionality (even right click, handled by libinput)
* MT touchpad functionality (two finger scroll, probably others)
* Interrupts!
* Suspend / resume

What doesn't work:
------------------
* Key rollover (properly)
* Wakeup on keypress / touchpad
 
Known bugs:
-----------
* Occasionally, the SPI device can get itself into a state where it causes an interrupt storm. There should be a way of resetting it, or better yet avoiding this state altogether.
* You shouldn't have to modify your DSDT to get it running.

Interrupts:
-----------
Interrupts are now working! This means that the driver is no longer polled, and should no longer be a massive battery drain. For more information on how the driver receives interrupts, see the discussion [here](https://github.com/cb22/macbook12-spi-driver/pull/1)

Touchpad:
---------
The touchpad protocol is the same as the bcm5974 driver. Perhaps there is a nice way of utilizing it? For now, bits of code have just been copy and pasted.

Touchbar:
---------
The touchbar driver is called `appletb`. It provides basic functionality, enabling the touchbar and switching between modes based on the FN key. Furthermore the touchbar is automatically switched off if no (internal) keyboard, touchpad, or touchbar input is received for 60 seconds; any (internal) keyboard or touchpad input switches it back on.
